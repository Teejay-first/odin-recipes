    <h2>dish description</h2>
<p>Chicken salad is a versatile and flavorful dish, typically made with tender, bite-sized pieces of cooked chicken mixed with a creamy dressing and various fresh ingredients. The dressing, usually based on mayonnaise, is rich and smooth, often complemented by the tanginess of Dijon mustard and the bright acidity of lemon juice.</p>
<p>The diced celery and red onion add a satisfying crunch and a touch of sharpness, while fresh parsley brings a burst of herbaceous flavor. Optional additions like dried cranberries or halved grapes introduce a hint of sweetness that balances the savory elements of the salad.</p>
<p>Overall, chicken salad offers a delightful combination of textures and flavors, making it a refreshing and satisfying option for a light lunch or snack. Itâ€™s perfect served chilled, either on its own, over a bed of lettuce, in a sandwich, or with crackers.</p>
<h2>ingredient list</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for fluffier eggs)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter or 1 teaspoon cooking oil</li>
    <li><em>Optional: fresh herbs (chives, parsley, dill) or grated cheese (cheddar, parmesan) for garnish</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>step-by-step process</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a knob of butter or a splash of oil to the pan. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk the Eggs:</strong>In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them vigorously until the yolks and whites are fully combined. For fluffier eggs, you can add a splash of milk or cream and continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and slightly frothy.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong> Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit for a few seconds without stirring, allowing the edges to begin setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Scramble: </strong>Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing them from the edges toward the center. Continue this motion, ensuring the eggs cook evenly and do not stick to the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking:</strong>Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs, ensuring they are soft and creamy.</li>
    <li><strong>and Serve:</strong>Add salt and pepper to taste, along with any additional herbs or cheese. Serve immediately while hot.</li>
</ol>
