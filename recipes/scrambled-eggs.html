<h2>dish description</h2>
<p>Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish characterized by their soft, creamy texture and rich, savory flavor. When perfectly cooked, they have a slightly custardy consistency, being tender and moist without being runny. The eggs are gently whisked to incorporate air, which helps to create a light and fluffy texture. As they cook, the eggs form small, delicate curds that provide a delightful mouthfeel.</p>
<p>The flavor of scrambled eggs is mild yet satisfying, with a subtle richness that can be enhanced by the addition of butter or cream during cooking. Seasoning with salt and pepper brings out the eggsâ€™ natural taste, while adding fresh herbs or cheese introduces extra layers of flavor. The overall experience of eating scrambled eggs is comforting and enjoyable, making them a beloved choice for breakfast or brunch.</p>
<h2>ingredient list</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for fluffier eggs)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter or 1 teaspoon cooking oil</li>
    <li><em>Optional: fresh herbs (chives, parsley, dill) or grated cheese (cheddar, parmesan) for garnish</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>step-by-step process</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a knob of butter or a splash of oil to the pan. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk the Eggs:</strong>In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them vigorously until the yolks and whites are fully combined. For fluffier eggs, you can add a splash of milk or cream and continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and slightly frothy.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong> Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit for a few seconds without stirring, allowing the edges to begin setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Scramble: </strong>Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing them from the edges toward the center. Continue this motion, ensuring the eggs cook evenly and do not stick to the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking:</strong>Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs, ensuring they are soft and creamy.</li>
    <li><strong>and Serve:</strong>Add salt and pepper to taste, along with any additional herbs or cheese. Serve immediately while hot.</li>
</ol>
